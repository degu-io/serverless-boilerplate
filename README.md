## Instructions
* This project consists of 3 independent parts. A serverless API (node), a serverless stream and a serverless web app (React). 
* Follow the README in each sub project for set up (but let's be honest, it's pretty self-explanatory). 

## Some folklore:
* No servers were harmed during the making of this app
* It's lambdas all the way down!
* Make your credit card the single point of failure
